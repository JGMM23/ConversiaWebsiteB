# What You Need to Do Right Now

## Before We Start - What I Need From You:
1. **Your domain name** (the one you bought from GoDaddy)
2. **AWS account** - Do you have one? If not, create one at aws.amazon.com

## Step 1: Test Your Build (Do This First)
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run build
```
This should create a `dist` folder with your website files.

## Step 2: AWS Account Setup
1. Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. Sign up for an account (you'll need a credit card)
3. Choose the free tier
4. Verify your account

## Step 3: Create S3 Bucket
1. Go to AWS Console → S3
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Name: `conversia-ai-website-[your-initials]` (must be unique globally)
4. Region: **us-east-1** (very important!)
5. **UNCHECK** "Block all public access"
6. Click "Create bucket"

## Step 4: Configure Your Bucket
1. Click on your new bucket
2. Go to "Properties" tab
3. Find "Static website hosting" → Click "Edit"
4. Select "Enable"
5. Index document: `index.html`
6. Error document: `index.html`
7. Click "Save changes"

## Step 5: Set Permissions
1. Go to "Permissions" tab
2. Click "Bucket policy" → "Edit"
3. Paste this (replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with your actual bucket name):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 6: Upload Your Website
1. Go back to your terminal and run: `npm run build`
2. In S3, go to "Objects" tab
3. Click "Upload"
4. Drag all files from your `dist` folder
5. Click "Upload"

## Step 7: Test Your Website
1. Go back to "Properties" tab
2. Find "Static website hosting"
3. Click the website URL
4. Your website should load!

## Once You Complete These Steps:
Tell me:
1. Your domain name
2. Your S3 bucket name
3. Whether the website loads from the S3 URL

Then I'll help you set up:
- CloudFront (for faster loading)
- SSL certificate (for https://)
- Your custom domain
