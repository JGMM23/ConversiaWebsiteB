# Your Next Steps - Start Here

I've prepared everything for your AWS deployment. Here's exactly what you need to do:

## What You Need Before Starting:
1. Your GoDaddy domain name
2. An AWS account (create at aws.amazon.com if you don't have one)
3. About 30 minutes of focused time

## Step 1: Build Your Website
Run this command:
```bash
node build-for-aws.js
```

This creates a `dist-aws` folder with your website files ready for deployment.

## Step 2: Create AWS S3 Bucket
1. Go to [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Bucket name: `conversia-ai-[your-name]` (must be globally unique)
4. Region: **us-east-1** (very important for CloudFront)
5. **UNCHECK** "Block all public access"
6. Click "Create bucket"

## Step 3: Enable Website Hosting
1. Click on your new bucket
2. Go to "Properties" tab
3. Scroll to "Static website hosting"
4. Click "Edit" → Select "Enable"
5. Index document: `index.html`
6. Error document: `index.html`
7. Save changes

## Step 4: Set Public Access
1. Go to "Permissions" tab
2. Click "Bucket policy" → "Edit"
3. Paste this policy (replace `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME`):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 5: Upload Files
1. Go to "Objects" tab
2. Click "Upload"
3. Upload all files from your `dist-aws` folder
4. Click "Upload"

## Step 6: Test
1. Go back to "Properties" → "Static website hosting"
2. Click the website endpoint URL
3. Your website should load

**Once this works, tell me:**
1. Your domain name
2. Your S3 bucket name
3. The S3 website URL

Then I'll help you set up CloudFront and connect your domain.
