# Push Your Files to GitHub

Your Conversia AI website files are ready locally. Here's how to push them to GitHub:

## Option 1: Using Replit's Git Integration
1. Click the "Version Control" tab in Replit (left sidebar)
2. Click "Commit & Push" 
3. Add commit message: "Add Conversia AI website with AWS deployment"
4. Click "Commit & Push"

## Option 2: Manual Git Commands (if needed)
If Replit's interface doesn't work, run these commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Conversia AI website with AWS deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Files That Will Be Pushed:
- `ready-to-deploy/index.html` - Your complete website
- `ready-to-deploy/assets/` - Website assets
- `AWS_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full deployment guide
- `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` - Quick deployment steps
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions for automation
- All other project files

## After Pushing:
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page

3. Proceed with AWS S3 deployment using DEPLOY_GUIDE.md
