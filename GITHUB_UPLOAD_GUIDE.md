# Upload Files to GitHub - Step by Step

Since the Version Control tab isn't available, upload files directly to GitHub:

## Method 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/JGMM23/ConversiaWebsite

2. **Click "uploading an existing file"** (you'll see this link on the main page)

3. **Upload these key files in order**:

   **First - Upload the website:**
   - Drag `ready-to-deploy/index.html` 
   - Drag entire `ready-to-deploy/assets/` folder
   - Drag entire `ready-to-deploy/images/` folder

   **Second - Upload deployment guides:**
   - `AWS_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`

   **Third - Upload GitHub Actions:**
   - Create folder `.github/workflows/`
   - Upload `deploy.yml` inside it

4. **Commit message**: "Add Conversia AI website and deployment files"

5. **Click "Commit changes"**

## Method 2: Create Files Directly in GitHub

1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Create new file"
3. For each file, copy content from Replit and paste into GitHub
4. Save each file

## Files to Upload:
- `ready-to-deploy/index.html` (9,426 bytes - your complete website)
- `ready-to-deploy/assets/` (CSS and JS files)
- `ready-to-deploy/images/` (website images)
- `AWS_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment guide)
- `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` (quick steps)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (automation)

## After Upload:
1. Refresh repository page to verify files
2. Proceed with AWS S3 deployment
3. Use the deployment guides to set up hosting

Your website is complete and ready - just needs to be moved to GitHub!
